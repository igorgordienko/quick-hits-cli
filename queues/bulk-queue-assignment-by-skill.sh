# >> START cli-assign-to-queue-by-skill A set of Genesys Cloud CLI commands the will identify a user by skill name and then add those users to a queue.

#######
#   Bulk assignment to a queue by skill
#  
#  This files show the list of Genesys Cloud CLI commands needed to find all the users with a skill and add those users to a queue.
#  This file is not a fully functional set of shell script, but rather a list of commands with a small shell script at the end to show to how to repeatedly
#  call the GC queue commands to add a 100 users at a time to a queue.  
#
#  Note: The 100 users at a time is a limitation on the routing API that restricts a dev from adding more then 100 users at a time.
######

# Step #1:   Get all of the users with their skills and redirect the output to a file.
gc users list -a --pageSize=100 --expand="skills" > users.json

# Step #2: Find the id of the Queue by retrieving all of the queues and using jq to parse the id of the queue
gc routing queues list -a --pageSize=100 --name="MyQueueName" | jq -r .[].id

# Step #3:  Find all of the users who have those users with the skill and then dump them a list of files
cat users.json | jq -c '.[] | select( .skills[].name | contains("MySkillName"))' | jq -n  '[inputs]'| jq > skills-user.json

#or for mulitple skills condition:
#cat users.json | jq -c '.[] | select( .skills[].name =="skill_name2" and .skills[].name =="skill_name1" and .skills[].name =="skill_name3" and .skills[].name == "skill_name4")' | jq -n  '[inputs]'| jq > skills-user.json

# Step #4:  Find out the total number of users with that skill
cat skills-user.json | jq .[].id | wc -l

# Step 5: You are going to iterate the total number of users/100 by 100.  If we have 5791 users with a skill, you are going to iterate 58 times.
for i in {0..58}
do
   userIndex=$i*100
   userFinal=$userIndex+100
   echo "----"
   echo "Index ${i} StartIndex: ${userIndex} and stop index ${userFinal}"

   # Chunk out 100 records from the skills-user.json file and create a set of files by batch to add the users to the queue. 
   cat skills-user.json | jq -r ".[$userIndex:$userFinal] | map({id: .id, username: .username, joined    : true})" > /tmp/joinedUsers-${i}.json

   # Add the users with the command below.  If you want to delete these users instead of adding them pass in the --delete=true flag
   gc routing queues members move QUEUE_ID_HERE -f /tmp/joinedUsers-${i}.json
done
